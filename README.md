# PlacePicker-React-Node

This project serves as a demonstration of a React frontend coupled with a Node.js backend. It primarily utilizes `useEffect`, `useCallback`, and `useState` hooks in React to interact with a dummy API provided by the backend.

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/PlacePicker-React-Node.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd PlacePicker-React-Node`
3. Install dependencies:
   - For the frontend (React), navigate to the `frontend` directory: `cd frontend` and run `npm install`.
   - For the backend (Node.js), navigate to the `backend` directory: `cd backend` and run `npm install`.

## Usage

### Starting the Backend Server

1. Go to the `backend` directory: `cd backend`
2. Run the backend server: `node app.js`

### Running the React Frontend

1. Go to the `frontend` directory: `cd frontend`
2. Start the React app: `npm run dev`

The React app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` by default.
